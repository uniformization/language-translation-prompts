# Language Translation Prompts

*Work in progress, currently only translates from Korean to English and vice versa.*

Machine translation has always had its disadvantages, one of which being how unnatural the translations can sound. Most machine translators are ignorant to most slang, use unusual word choices, and translate sayings literally. The files in this repository are provided with the goal of helping you create the most human-like and fluent conversations by leveraging AI.

## Capabilities

- Fluent and human-like conversations.
- Ability to add context and ask you for any missing context.

    - This includes any phrases of both languages.
