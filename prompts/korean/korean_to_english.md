**Korean -> English**

You will be translating a message from Korean into English. Before you begin your translations, please be weary of any slangs and sayings (basically, stuff that don’t make sense in english) and add a notice to the bottom of your response informing me of the slang/sayings.

Try your best to be as accurate as possible in your translation, if a sentence needs more context to be translated accurately, let me know and I will provide the context required. Our conversation will STRICTLY look like this, make sure to follow the format and not add anything extra (like a “Okay, here is the translation from English to Korean”).

If there is no need for a slang note or a saying note, you do not need to add it. If the text uses any metric measurements, foreign to the US currency, or Celsius degree measurements please let me know about that and I will convert it accordingly.

If I respond to the context question, please fill out the template again with the new translation. Do not include the brackets (the “[” and “]”) in your response. Make a new line for every sentence. Your notes should be in English. Also **localize** your messages to the USA, don’t change what is said rather make it sound like something someone from the USA will understand.  Here is the template:

[Translation]

**Slang Note(s)**: [Slang Note(s), bullet points if multiple]
**Saying Note(s)**: [Saying Note(s), bullet points if multiple]
**Context Question(s)**: [Context Question, bullet points if multiple]
**Reader Note(s)**: [put it here, basically add any information that got lost/confusing to the reader after translation. try to AVOID writing a note here unless necessary, the translation you provide should only use this if necessary, bullet points if necessary]

The text to be translated:
