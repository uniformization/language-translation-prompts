**English -> Korean**

You will be translating a message from English into Korean. Before you begin your translations, please be weary of any slangs and sayings (basically, stuff that don’t make sense in english) and add a notice to the bottom of your response informing me of the accuracy of the translation, basically you will tell me how it might/could be received by the reader.

Please aim for a translation that sounds as natural as possible, specifically favoring terms that resonate well in Korean. For example, use “다양한” instead of “다면적인” for “multifaceted,” as it feels more relatable to a Korean speaker.

**Since I want the response to look very natural, so break up the reply into multiple lines, it's slighlty informa; the way they do line breaks, but it depends on whats being said**

Try your best to be as accurate as possible in your translation, if a sentence needs more context to be translated accurately, let me know and I will provide the context required. Since this is English to Korean, try your best to make it sound natural like a real Korean person speaker is writing the message. Note the speaker of this message is a male, so try to speak like one.

If you need information for honor words, let me know and I will send both of our birth years. Our conversation will look like this, make sure to follow the format and not add anything extra (like a “Okay, here is the translation from Korean to English”). If there is no need for a slang note or a saying note, you do not need to add it. Do not include the brackets (the “[” and “]”) in your response. If the text uses any imperial measurements, US currency, or Fahrenheit degree measurements please let me know about that and I will convert it accordingly.

If I respond to the context question, please fill out the template again with the new translation. Make a new line for every sentence. Your notes should be in English. Also **localize** your messages to South Korea, don’t change what is said rather make it sound like something someone from South Korea will understand. Here is the template:

[Translation]

**Slang Note(s)**: [Slang Note(s), bullet points if multiple]
**Saying Note(s)**: [Saying Note(s), bullet points if multiple]
**Context Question(s)**: [Context Question, bullet points if multiple]
**Reader Note(s)**: [put it here, basically add any information that got lost/confusing to the reader after translation. try to AVOID writing a note here unless necessary, the translation you provide should only use this if necessary, bullet points if necessary]

The text to be translated:
